TracFone is a Verizon company.\\n\\nOur Privacy Policy describes the information that we collect, how it’s used, shared, and retained, your choices about how it’s used and shared, and your rights under certain privacy laws.When you use our websites and services you are subject to this Policy and the terms and conditions of the service associated with your brand. We do not require you to provide personal information to us to enjoy some of our services. However, if you do not provide certain personal information, you may not be able to use or access portions of our websites, such as the account features or account information.\\n\\nCategories and Types of Personal Information We Collect\\n\\nWe, and service providers acting on our behalf, collect information when you purchase and use our products and services and when you interact with us. Depending on the products and services you use, the personal information we collect may include:\\n\\nIf a child or other beneficiary is the qualifying recipient for the Lifeline Assistance Program, we will also collect the child’s or other beneficiary’s name, date of birth, and partial Social Security number to verify their eligibility in the program.\\n\\nHow We Collect Personal Information\\n\\nWe collect information from you when you interact with us and use our products and services, including information about how you use these products and services and our websites, when you make a purchase, or when you establish or modify an online account. We also collect information when you interact with our customer service representatives or use our websites or apps to place an order or ask questions about your account or service; seek technical support; contact us on social media; enter a TracFone-sponsored or affiliate contest; participate in surveys, sweepstakes or promotions; refer a friend or respond to a referral; or participate in our rewards program. When you communicate with us, we may monitor or record the interaction to help us better serve you; to personalize your experiences; to train or otherwise support employees, resources or systems; and for fraud detection and security purposes. We may use artificial intelligence guided by humans, such as chat bots, to respond to your inquiry. When you interact with us through third-party services like Facebook Messenger or Twitter Direct Message, your communications are also governed by these companies’ privacy policies.\\n\\nSome devices may have pre-installed applications that are used by us and our partners to:\\n\\nSome apps installed or updated on your device in this way do not appear as icons on your device screen because of their limited utility. For example, they might facilitate the download of apps you select for your device, update apps you already have on your device, or report to an app owner that an app has been opened on the device. You can see and also delete or disable apps installed on your device, whether or not they have visible icons, using your device’s Application Manager under Settings. Apps on your device are governed by their own terms and privacy policies.\\n\\nWe, our vendors, and third party companies, collect information from our sites and apps for operational purposes such as improving website and app security, authenticating you, detecting and deterring fraud, improving site performance and providing content and analytics. We and these vendors and third-party companies may use cookies, pixels, web beacons, tags, scripts or similar technologies on our pages and the browsers you use and may access advertising identifiers from your mobile device operating systems.\\n\\nWe also collect information from third parties. This includes demographic and interest data as well as device type, carrier, city and state information from third party data providers; information from social media platforms when you interact with us via social media or use your social media login to interact with TracFone sites or offers; contact, marketing lead, and other information we purchase or receive; and fraud information.\\n\\nWe also allow third-party advertising companies to collect information about your activity on our websites and in our app, for example through cookies, mobile ad identifiers, pixels, web beacons, application programming interfaces (APIs) and social network plugins, to help us provide more relevant TracFone advertisements on our website and on others’ sites and apps. These ads may be tailored for you based on your activity on our sites and combined with your activities on other websites and in apps where these advertising companies are present. These advertising companies may also use information they collect for others’ advertising purposes. The use of information collected about your visits over time and across different websites, apps and devices is known as cross-context behavioral, or interest-based, advertising.\\n\\nHow We Use Personal Information\\n\\nTracFone uses personal information to:\\n\\nAnalytics. We use mobile analytics software to better understand the functionalities of our mobile software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use an application, the events that occur within an application, aggregated usage, performance data, and location where an application was downloaded. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within a mobile application.\\n\\nAutomated Processing. We may use automated techniques including artificial intelligence to assist us with these uses. For example, we may use machine learning techniques with information we have about you and other customers to provide you with more relevant marketing messages or predict what services might most interest you.\\n\\nDe-identified and aggregated information. We may also de-identify or aggregate information so that we or our affiliates may use it for business and marketing purposes. For example, the data we aggregate might be used to analyze, personalize and improve our services. We may de-identify your CPNI and, if we do so, we will maintain and use the data in a non-individually identifiable form and will not attempt to re-identify the data.\\n\\nHow We Share Personal Information\\n\\nWe share information within TracFone and other Verizon companies.\\n\\nWe share information within TracFone and with other Verizon companies for a variety of purposes, including providing you the latest information about our products and services and offering you our latest promotions.\\n\\nWe share information with service providers and partners.\\n\\nWe share information with service providers. We use service providers to perform services on our behalf, such as marketing and account related communications, fulfillment services, shipping to customers and to help us offer, provide, repair, restore and bill for services. We require that service providers protect and restrict use of personal information consistent with the terms described in this Policy. Your wireless number may be shared for text messaging services operated by service providers. These service providers may directly contact you on our behalf by text messages with promotions, discounts, advertisements, reminders related to your services, or other information that may be helpful or informative to you. You can opt out of these messages using the mechanism provided.\\n\\nWe share information that identifies you with a partner who verifies your identity to facilitate your interactions with third parties, such as banks. Our partner also uses the information we share to assist third parties with decisions about credit applications that you submitted to a bank or other third party. Information about how to opt out of the disclosure of information for this purpose is in the “Your Choices About How Information is Used” section.\\n\\nWe may share with or we may allow our service providers to collect personal information, including your activity on our sites and in our apps. These companies may use technologies, such as cookies, pixels, web beacons, tags, scripts, or similar technologies on our pages and the browsers you use. These service providers help us improve website and app security, authenticate you, detect and deter fraud, improve site performance, provide content or analytics, and other purposes as described in the “How we collect personal information” section.\\n\\nWalmart Family Mobile Customers. If you are a Walmart Family Mobile customer, we work with Walmart Stores, Inc. (\"Walmart\") to offer the Walmart Family Mobile service. Any information you provide directly to Walmart will be subject to Walmart\\'s Privacy Policy, not this one. This includes information you provide to Walmart in connection with your device purchase, upgrade, return, or replacement, whether in its stores, by phone or online, including but not limited to, if you purchase a Family Mobile device or obtain technical support for the device at or from Walmart or its agents. In addition, if you activate Walmart Family Mobile communications services at a Walmart store, Walmart may request personal information from you that is passed to TracFone as part of the activation process, but which may also be retained by Walmart. You can learn more by visiting Walmart\\'s Privacy Policy.\\n\\nSoftware Application for Our Websites. TracFone also works with other companies who supply software applications for use on our websites. The software is used to collect survey or feedback information or support real-time chat sessions from customers who visit our websites and utilize these tools. Information from your web session, including your device serial number, phone number, and account email may be associated with your responses when you use these tools. This information is used by TracFone exclusively for analysis of survey or feedback results and will not be shared with any third party for any other purposes.\\n\\nWhen you purchase or use services that are offered jointly by TracFone and one of our partners, both parties may receive information. When this is the case, you should also review the partner company’s privacy policy because it may describe uses of information that are different from ours.\\n\\nWe also share de-identified information with companies to assist with the delivery of advertising campaigns or aggregate reports.\\n\\nWe share information with advertising companies.\\n\\nWe may share, or allow certain third-party advertising companies to collect information about your activity on our sites and in our apps, including advertising identifiers from your mobile device operating system. They can use that information to help us provide more relevant TracFone advertising on our own and other sites and apps. These companies may combine information from our sites with similar information they collect on other sites to determine whether you fit into an audience that advertisers, including TracFone, are trying to reach, to serve targeted advertising to you on our sites and other sites and platforms, or to find other potential customers. To do this, we and these companies use technologies, such as cookies, pixels, web beacons, tags, scripts, or similar technologies on our pages and the browsers you use, or we may share information using application program interfaces (APIs).\\n\\nTracFone sites and services may also include social networks or other third-party plug-ins and widgets that may provide information to their associated social networks or third parties even if you do not click on or otherwise interact with the plug-ins and widgets\\n\\nOur customers and website visitors can limit the sale and sharing of personal information as well as the use of this information for certain types of targeted advertising. Certain states give consumers who reside in those states the right to make these opt out choices. Please visit the “Your choices about how information is used” section of this policy to learn how to opt out. Page Plus does not currently engage in this type of activity.\\n\\nWe also share de-identified information with companies to assist with the delivery of advertising campaigns or aggregate reports.\\n\\nAdditional ways we may share information.\\n\\nWe may further share customer personal information in the following situations:\\n\\nYour choices about how information is used.\\n\\nYou have choices about how we reach you with marketing offers and about how we use certain information we have about you.\\n\\nWe may send you emails regarding promotional offers or other news. You can choose not to receive our email direct marketing communications at any time by opting-out or unsubscribing. You can do this by clicking on the unsubscribe link found at the bottom of every email promotion we deliver. Upon such election, we will not email you directly with promotional messages, though you may see marketing messages from TracFone in other forms and directed at a general audience.\\n\\nYou can limit the sale and sharing of website information, as well as the use of this information for certain targeted advertising. You can opt out by visiting the Your Privacy Choices page at the bottom of your brand’s website. This page also describes how we honor Global Privacy Control signals you may set on your browser. We do not respond to Do Not Track signals.\\n\\nYou can also use the Your Privacy Choices page at the bottom of your brand’s website to opt out of the disclosure of information to our partner who verifies your identity to facilitate your interactions with third parties, such as banks. Our partner also uses the information we share to assist third parties with decisions about credit applications that you submitted to a bank or other third party.\\n\\nYou can opt out of interest-based advertising on mobile apps on your mobile device. Apple devices allow apps to include interest-based advertising only if you opt in using the app’s pop-up notice. You can change your choice using Apple device settings. On Android devices, you can opt out using your device setting to “Opt out of Ads Personalization”. You can also manage cookies using features and functions available on most Internet browsers that allow you to delete or disable cookies and even choose what types of cookies may be placed on your device. Please be aware that disabling cookies may prevent you from using specific features on our sites and other sites, such as ordering products or services and maintaining an online account. Please note that some of the controls described above are device or browser-based. You will need to record your choices on each device or browser where you want them to be in place. In addition, your opt-outs may be stored via cookies. If you clear your cookies, please check to make sure your opt-outs are in place. More information about cookie controls for specific browsers can be found here:\\n\\nIf you allow it, our apps may collect your precise geolocation. The app uses this information for the purposes described when at the time you granted permission. You may opt out at any time by changing the location settings for the apps you use on your mobile device.\\n\\nOur apps may also request permission to send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about events and offers that may interest you and to provide account notifications. If you do not wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off using your device controls.\\n\\nHow We Secure and Retain Personal Information\\n\\nWe use administrative, organizational, technical, and physical safeguards to protect against the unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of information we collect or store. In addition, we train our employees on the importance of privacy and security, as well as the proper ways to access, use and disclose customer information. Our practices and policies prohibit employees with whom we share this information from using sensitive information unless they are authorized to do so and have a business need.\\n\\nWe retain personal information as long as it is needed for business, tax, audit, investigative, security and/or legal purposes and then securely delete or destroy them. We incorporate personal information into different types of records, not always by distinct data elements. For example, your name may be part of your account, billing, technical support and call detail records.\\n\\nAlthough we strive to keep information secure, we can’t guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or disclose personal information. If you become aware of a security issue, please contact us at privacy@tracfone.com.\\n\\nLinks to Other Websites\\n\\nThird-Party Links. Our websites may contain links to other websites that are not owned, operated, or controlled by us. Any personal information collected by such third-party websites is not governed by this Policy. We recommend that you examine the privacy policies of such third-party websites prior to submitting any personal information.\\n\\nAdvertisements may appear on pages throughout our websites. Some advertisements may request information directly from you or provide links to take you to websites that may request personal information. We have no control over these advertisers\\' privacy policies, so we encourage you to review the privacy policy of any company advertising on our websites prior to submitting any personal information.\\n\\nThird-Party Websites. In some instances, our websites’ content is also featured on other websites with differing or non-existent privacy policies. These websites may collect personal information from website visitors that may or may not be used in conjunction with our website information. Prior to supplying personal information to any third-party company linking to our website, please read and understand their privacy policies.\\n\\nPolicy Regarding Information Obtained from Children\\n\\nOur websites are not structured to attract children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect information, directly or passively, from children under the age of 18. Ordering online products and services from TracFone is limited to adults (ages 18+). Of course, wireless devices and services purchased for family use may be used by minors without our knowledge. If that happens, any information collected from the usage will appear to be the personal information of the adult subscriber and treated as such under this Policy.\\n\\nPublic Forums/Blogs\\n\\nOur websites may offer publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. You should not provide personally identifiable information in any publicly accessible blog or community forum.\\n\\nTo request removal of personal information from our blogs and forums, contact us at privacy@tracfone.com, and we will do our best to comply with the request. In some cases, we may not be able to remove personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.\\n\\nRefer-A-Friend\\n\\nIf you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our websites, we will ask you for your friend\\'s name and email address and automatically generate a one-time email to send your friend inviting them to visit the site. If you use the “Import Contacts” feature, we may collect your friends’ names and addresses in order to administer TracFone’s Refer-A-Friend program. We do not store your friend\\'s information or use it for any other purpose.\\n\\nGift Purchases\\n\\nIf you purchase a gift, we will ask you for the recipient’s name and mailing address in order to ship the product to the individual. We do not retain the recipient’s information or use it for any other purpose.\\n\\nHow Customers and Visitors Can Access and Update Personal Information\\n\\nYou can verify your account and manage personal information, including deleting or changing certain personal information, by logging into your account on our website and going to the account profile or account information section.\\n\\nIf you are unable to log into your account, please contact a customer care agent by calling 1-800-867-7183. All requests for changes or deletion of account information require account verification by answering security questions or providing the Personal Identification Number (PIN) you set when you first activated your account.\\n\\nIn certain circumstances we may be required by law to retain personal information, or may need to retain personal information in order to continue providing a service.\\n\\nU.S. State Privacy Laws\\n\\nCalifornia\\n\\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, gives you specific rights as a California resident. The law provides you with the right to know what information we collect about you and how we use it; to access, delete, and correct that information within certain limitations; to tell us not to sell or share personal information about you; to limit the use of certain sensitive personal information; and to not be discriminated against for invoking these rights.\\n\\nYour Right to Know\\n\\nWe describe the personal information we collect and how we use it in this Privacy Policy. As detailed above in “How We Collect Personal Information,” we collect information from you when you interact with us and use our products and services.\\n\\nDepending on what products and services you use and how you interact with us, we may collect these categories of personal information, some of which may be considered sensitive personal information under California law:\\n\\nOur policies require that we retain records for as long they are needed for legal, tax, audit, investigative, and/or security purposes and then securely delete or destroy them. We incorporate personal information into different types of records, not always by distinct data elements. For example, your name could be part of your customer account record, transaction record, or call records. Each type of record may be retained for a different time period depending on its purpose. We have established criteria for how long to keep different types of records.\\n\\nWe, and our affiliates, use the information we collect for business and commercial purposes as defined by the CCPA. Business and commercial purposes include providing services to you; communicating with you and providing customer service; personalizing your experiences; improving our services; providing marketing and advertising; debugging; auditing our processes and services; short-term transient uses; research; and security, fraud, and legal compliance purposes.\\n\\nService providers may use information for the same purposes, as necessary for them to perform work for us (including in the last twelve months). Service providers are required to protect the information we share with them or they collect on our behalf and use it only for the specific purposes that we allow. We may also disclose information to third parties, such as partners and to law enforcement, among others, as detailed elsewhere in this policy.\\n\\nWe share information that identifies you with a partner who facilitates your interactions with third parties, including for verifying your identity and providing information to assist with a decision on a credit application you have submitted to a bank or other third party.\\n\\nWe also allow select third parties to directly collect information about your activity on our websites and in our apps using cookies, mobile ad identifiers, pixels, web beacons, social network plugins and similar technologies to inform our and others’ cross contextual advertising. These activities may be considered selling or sharing personal information under California law. For information about how to opt out of these activities, and to learn more about TracFone’s selling and sharing activities, please visit our “Your Privacy Choices” pages linked in the “Your Right to Opt Out of Selling and Sharing Personal Information” section below. We do not knowingly sell or share personal information related to children under 16 years of age.\\n\\nSome of the information that we collect is Sensitive Personal Information under California Law. California law defines sensitive personal information as:\\n\\nWe do not use, sell, share, or disclose sensitive personal information for any purpose other than to provide the goods or services requested by you, with your consent, or for other purposes expressly authorized by California law, such as to detect security incidents.\\n\\nWe may offer financial incentives for information that you provide through discounts and coupons for service. To the extent we can determine the value of your information, we consider the value of your information reasonably related to the cost of the incentive that we offer.\\n\\nYour Right to Access and Correct Information\\n\\nYou have the right to request access to specific pieces and categories of personal information we collect about you. You may submit these requests as described below under “How to Submit Your Privacy Rights Request.” We will honor at least two access rights requests every twelve months as required by California law. To the extent technically feasible, we will provide this information to you in a portable and readily usable format. You also can request that we correct inaccurate personal information we have about you.\\n\\nYour Right to Delete\\n\\nYou have the right to request that we delete personal information we have about you. We are unable to delete information that is necessary to provide you ongoing service, for security purposes, that we are contractually obligated to retain, or that is necessary to comply with legal obligations. You or your authorized agent may submit a request to delete. Instructions on how to submit this request can be found below under “How to Submit Your CCPA Request.”\\n\\nYour Right to Opt Out of the Sale and Sharing of Personal Information\\n\\nCalifornia consumers have the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information. The term “sale or sharing” is defined to include sharing personal information for monetary or other valuable consideration and the sharing of personal information for cross contextual advertising purposes, but does not cover all sharing of personal information. We do not knowingly include the personal information of consumers under 16 years of age in this selling or sharing.\\n\\nOur activities that fall under the definition of “sale or share” in the CCPA are:\\n\\nTo opt out of the selling and sharing of personal information, including for identify verification and credit inquiry purposes, please visit our Your Privacy Choices pages, available at:\\n\\nWe also recognize that you are exercising your choice to opt out if you engage a browser-based Global Privacy Control (GPC) when visiting our sites. If you are not logged in or don’t have an account and use a GPC on your visit, we will apply your choice to stop third-party cookies, pixels, and other similar technology on our sites from collecting, using, and sharing information about you from your visit to our website for purposes of tailoring ads to you, from us and others, based on your online behavior and activity. You will be opted out of sharing activity while you are on our sites whenever you have your GPC turned on, but we need more information from you to identify you and apply your opt out of selling and sharing to your phone and email information. Page Plus does not currently engage in this type of activity.\\n\\nIf you are a member who is logged in to your account when using the GPC signal to opt out, we will apply your choice to block third-party ad technology, and we will also opt you out of any selling and sharing of personal information associated with your account.\\n\\nClearway Wireless for Business does not sell or share personal information.\\n\\nYour Right to Limit the Use of Sensitive Personal Information\\n\\nYou have the right to ask us to limit the use and disclosure of sensitive personal information if we use that information for purposes beyond what is needed to provide the products and services you request or for other reasons specified in the law. We use or disclose sensitive personal information only for purposes allowable in the law or with your consent so we do not offer you an option to limit the use of sensitive personal information. The purposes for which we might use sensitive personal information include: detecting security incidents; resisting malicious, deceptive, fraudulent or illegal actions; ensuring the physical safety of a person; short-term, transient uses; performing services such as maintaining or servicing accounts, providing customer service, fulfilling orders and transactions; verifying personal information; and verifying, maintaining or enhancing a service on a device that is owned manufactured or controlled by us or on your device. We may also share personal information with service providers providing storage or similar services on our behalf.\\n\\nYour Right to Not Be Discriminated Against\\n\\nWe do not discriminate against you if you exercise any rights described in this section.
